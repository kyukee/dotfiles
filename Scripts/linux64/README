  The files should be copied to a directory in the PATH ('echo $PATH' to see
  the current PATH list). Usual places include the users bin/ directory $HOME/bin
  if it exists (can be created and then added to the PATH in .bashrc on your
  home directory), or /usr/local/bin if you can root the machine.

  Most of these executables can be installed from the linux system provider
  (ubunto, debian, red-hat, ...).
  In ubunto: apt-get install flex
  In fedora: yum install flex
